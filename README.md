Frontend for Tigum online learning tool, built with React/Typescript


# Motivation

Tigum is a tool for creating your own private personalized university using content collected from the internet.

Over the last few years I've been learning how to write software. About 95% of the resources I have used have been videos, blog posts and offical documentation. The internet has given me the access to a world of knowledge which has allowed me to enter into a career in software and so far I love it.

This tool will allow me to centralize online resources that I find the most useful in helping learn about different topics. I will also be able to take my own notes on those resources so that I can describe concepts in my own words/code.

Access to this tool will be completely private but if I wish to share that content I can make it public and it will show up on the tigum public feed. If I want to use the content elsewhere I can export my notes/resources to a html doc.
